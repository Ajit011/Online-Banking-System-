# Online Banking System

An **Online Banking System** built in Java that allows users to manage their bank accounts, perform transactions, view account details, and manage profiles. This project demonstrates key programming concepts like object-oriented design, file handling, and exception management in Java.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and login functionality for users.
- **Account Management**: View account details, check balance, and manage profiles.
- **Transactions**: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers.
- **Mini Statement**: View a history of recent transactions.
- **Admin Access**: Special access to manage user accounts and oversee transactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: The main programming language used for backend logic.
- **File Handling**: To store user and transaction data (can be later integrated with a database).
- **OOP Principles**: For modularity, flexibility, and code maintainability.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 8 or above**
- Any IDE supporting Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- Basic knowledge of object-oriented programming and file handling in Java

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OnlineBankingSystem.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd OnlineBankingSystem
   ```
3. **Compile the Java code**:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

## Usage

1. **User Registration**:
   - New users can register by providing personal and account details.
2. **User Login**:
   - Registered users can log in using their account credentials.
3. **Account Features**:
   - Users can check their balance, perform deposits and withdrawals, view recent transactions, and manage their profiles.
4. **Admin Access**:
   - The admin can view all user accounts and transaction histories.


## Future Improvements

- Integrate with a **database** like MySQL for persistent storage.
- Implement **encryption** for secure handling of user credentials.
- Add **graphical user interface (GUI)** using JavaFX or Swing.
- Implement **REST APIs** to make the system accessible over the web.
